Presentation time 

Aaron Finch: "We were about 20 or 30 short. Especially after we lost one wicket, we had to take it deeper. 
But our bowlers did well, continued taking wickets, and they were really good. If you have a guy go on and 
get 80, and that's what you are trying to do. Just a bit more attention to detail. We tried our best with the 
ball. I think our quicks are most effective when they are banging the wicket. There were a few plays-and-
misses, but that happens against a high-quality side." 

Virat Kohli: "It was a difficult game. I thought we did really 
well with the ball. The wicket didn't offer as much as it did 
under the lights. Their partnership was outstandin. I think 
the bowling (won the game for us) although we wanted to 
get a partnership going. The way Kedar and MS took 
responsibility was outstanding. (On Jadeja) Amazing. 10 
overs for less than 35 runs. Just the tight lines he bowled 
and set the fields accordingly. He's a great asset in the field 
too. (On Kuldeep and Shami) Brilliant, the way Shami has 
come into the white-ball set up. Never seen him so lean 
before. Got Maxi (Maxwell) out on 40-odd with a beautiful 
wicket. Just looking good for the World Cup. 

Mohammad Shami tells Sanjay Manjrekar: "This year has 
been one where we have worked really hard. We enjoy our 
training and you get to the see the results on the field. I 
hope that we continue to enjoy playing together and 
performing for the country. (On consistency across spells) 
There have been ups and downs in life, but it is cricket that 
has brought me here. I just try to give my best for the team, 
and I keep taking feedback from the experienced players. I 
have focused more on my line and length in the last 18 
months. (On fitness) When I returned from injuries, I had 
gone up to 93kg, and then I realised I needed to lose 
weight. I thank every one who pushes me, and I have 
maintained my weight since then."
